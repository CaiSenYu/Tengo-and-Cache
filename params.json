It's also a play on words on that 80s classic 'Tango and Cash'.  \r\n\r\nSo what's is all about then?\r\n----------------------------\r\n\r\nThis project was born from a desire to push on from some work of creating iPhone applications using only web technologies that I had done some time ago. That work can be seen http://github.com/robb1e/iWeb.  This first project was a way of deploying a HTML/CSS/Javascript application onto an iOS device and have it run as a native application.  \r\n\r\nThe issue with that was the only way to change HTML, CSS, Javascript, images or other data was to depend on a live internet connection or do an application update.  I was looking for a way to make it easier to cache those resources with a specific eye on offline experience.  \r\n\r\nAfter some thought, the lightbulb switched on and it became an immediate choice to use the HTML5 Cache Manifest file as a basis of discovering what resources should cached.  This project aims to do just that.\r\n\r\nBetween the application bootstrapping and a webpage being rendered, the cache manifest is read and each file is downloaded and stored in the iOS application sandbox directory.  After all files have been saved, the UIWebView will render an index.html file in that sandbox.  \r\n\r\nHow to use it\r\n-------------\r\n\r\n* You'll need the iOS SDK, I've been using 3.x.  \r\n* Open the Cachemanifest.xcodeproj file in xCode\r\n* Open Cachemanifest-Info.plist file\r\n** alter the values for AppUri and Manifest accordingly to point at your domain and manifest file\r\n* Run the project, if you watch the console, you should see plenty of logging\r\n\r\nCurrent Limitations/Opportunities for Improvement\r\n-------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nCurrently the application doesn't adhere to all of the HTML5 cache manifest directives.  For instance, all resources in 'network' are downloaded where they should be ignored.\r\n\r\nUsing Fallback will probably break this app at the moment, and it certainly won't don't any redirecting if there's no network connection.\r\n\r\nThe application doesn't raise any events as described by section 5.6.1.1 from here: http://www.w3.org/TR/html5/offline.html - I'm not certain that all are relevant but some can certainly be fired using the stringByEvaluatingJavaScriptFromString method on the UIWebView.\r\n\r\nIf your application tries to reach out to the web, the URI must include the domain, or it will only look in the cache.  It would be possible for the application to intercept the HTTP request and prepend the domain from the plist file if not in the cache.\r\n\r\n","name":"Tengo-and-cache","tagline":"I have and cache.
